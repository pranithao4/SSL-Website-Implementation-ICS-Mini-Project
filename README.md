# SSL-Website-Implementation-ICS-Mini-Project
A simple demonstration of implementing SSL (HTTPS) in a local website using Python, Flask, and a self-signed certificate — completed as part of the Information &amp; Cyber Security (ICS) lab in 3rd year B.Tech CSE–AIML.
🔒 SSL Implementation Demo

This is a small project where I implemented SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) in a local website as part of my Information & Cyber Security (ICS) subject in 3rd year B.Tech, CSE–AIML.

The project demonstrates how to:

Generate a self-signed SSL certificate

Configure a web server to run on HTTPS

Understand how browsers verify certificates

Serve a simple website securely using Flask

🚀 How to Run

Install Flask:

py -m pip install flask


Run the server:

python app.py


Open in browser:
👉 https://localhost:8443

(Click Proceed because the certificate is self-signed.)

📁 Project Files
app.py
cert.pem
key.pem
index.html

🎯 Summary

This project helped me understand practical HTTPS security, SSL certificates, encryption, and secure web communication.
